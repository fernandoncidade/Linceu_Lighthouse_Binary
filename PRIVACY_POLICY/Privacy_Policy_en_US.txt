Linceu Lighthouse Privacy Policy
Last updated: September 02, 2025
Version 0.0.4.0

Your privacy is fundamental to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information Linceu Lighthouse ("Software") uses and, more importantly, how it remains under your control.

By using Linceu Lighthouse, you agree to the practices described herein.

1. Core Principle: Local Privacy

Linceu Lighthouse was designed with privacy as a central pillar. All information and data generated by monitoring are processed and stored exclusively on your local computer. No information is transmitted to our servers or to third parties.

2. Information Processed by the Software

To perform its functions, the Software accesses and processes the following types of data:

 - File Monitoring Data: The Software reads metadata from the files and folders in the directories you choose to monitor. This includes file names, directory paths, creation/modification dates, size, and type. This information is necessary to detect and log creation, modification, deletion, and renaming operations.
 - Diagnostics and System Data: To ensure proper functionality and optimize the experience, the Software may check basic system information, such as the operating system version and language settings. It may also generate local error logs to help diagnose technical issues.

Although the Software accesses file paths that may contain personal information (e.g., "C:\Users\YourName\Documents"), it does not collect or transmit this information outside of your device.

3. Use of Information

The information processed by Linceu Lighthouse is used exclusively to:

 - Provide the core functionality of file and folder monitoring.
 - Display the activity log in the program's graphical interface.
 - Allow you to filter, search, and analyze the monitored events.
 - Generate charts and statistics for local viewing.
 - Enable you to export the data to file formats of your choice.

4. Data Storage, Security, and Sharing

 - Storage: All monitoring data is stored in a local database on your computer. You have full control over this file.
 - Security: The security of your data depends on the security of your own computer. Since the Software does not transmit data over the internet, the risk of external access is minimized.
 - Sharing: Linceu Lighthouse does not collect, transmit, or share any of your monitoring information with the developer or third parties. Any data sharing, such as exporting a report, is an action performed and controlled exclusively by you.

5. Your Rights and Full Control

You have absolute control over your data. At any time, you can:

 - Choose exactly which directories to monitor.
 - Start and stop monitoring whenever you wish.
 - View, filter, and search all recorded data.
 - Export the data to a location of your choice on your computer.
 - Clear the entire monitoring history directly from the Software's interface.
 - Uninstall the Software, which will remove the application and its components from your system. The database and log files can be manually deleted by you to ensure complete removal.

6. Microsoft Error Reporting Data

To improve the stability and quality of Linceu Lighthouse, we may use the Microsoft Error Reporting service. If the application encounters a critical error, anonymous diagnostic information may be sent to Microsoft and subsequently shared with us.

This practice is governed by the Microsoft App Developer Agreement. The error data we receive is used exclusively to fix bugs and improve the software. These reports do not include your personal files or any information that directly identifies you.

7. Children's Privacy

Linceu Lighthouse is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information.

8. Changes to this Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. We will notify you of any changes by updating the date at the top of this document and, where appropriate, through a notification within the Software.
