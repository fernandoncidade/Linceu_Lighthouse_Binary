RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.5.0:

In this new version, the following improvements and features have been implemented:

User Experience Enhancement:
- It is now possible to pause any stage of monitoring.
    - During the pause, the system temporarily stops data collection, allowing the user to make adjustments or changes without new data being processed.
    - The pause functionality can be activated or deactivated at any time, providing greater control over monitoring.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.4.0

In this new version, the following improvements and features have been implemented:

Bug Fixes:
- An error related to the start/stop analysis command has been fixed:
    - The issue occurred when the process was stopped during scanning, the initial stage of monitoring. Now, the system correctly handles this situation, preventing unexpected failures.

- Fixed an issue when opening the "Advanced Color Selector" in the settings menu. Clicking the corresponding button did not open the dialog window with the advanced color settings, which was an error.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.3.0:

In this new release, the following improvements and features have been implemented:

Improved Robustness and Stability:
- Existence checks were added before accessing object methods and properties, making the system more robust and preventing unexpected errors during initialization.
- The method _invalidar_cache_cores_ is now called only if it actually exists, preventing exceptions from invalid calls.
- The attribute _cor_selecao_future_, which was undefined, was removed, eliminating unnecessary error messages and providing a smoother experience.

Optimization of Processes and Interface:
- The control of calls for retranslation of data was optimized: when changing the language, the system performs only the essential operations, avoiding unnecessary processing and increasing agility in language switching.
- The methods for updating headers, data and column visibility were refactored with exception handling and clarity improvements, reflecting changes in the interface more accurately and quickly.
- Column index management was adjusted to ensure consistency and avoid errors, allowing manipulation of columns without sorting or display issues.
- Integration between data update, headers and visibility was improved, ensuring that all changes are correctly reflected in the interface.

General Fixes and Improvements:
- Several adjustments were made in processing methods, resulting in greater stability and performance, with fewer interruptions for the user.

Summary:

What's New in Version 0.0.3.0:

- Robustness and Stability:
    - Existence checks for attributes and methods to avoid unexpected errors.
    - Removal of undefined attributes and invalid calls.

- Interface and Process Optimization:
    - Efficient control of retranslation when switching languages.
    - Refactoring of interface update methods.
    - Adjustment and integration in column management.

- General Improvements:
    - Minor fixes and enhancements in processing methods, increasing the system's stability and performance.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.2.0:

In this new version, the following improvements and features have been implemented:

Complete refactoring of the internationalization system:
- The language and translation system has been entirely rewritten, now using the native resources of the PySide6 framework and the Qt library. This change has resulted in a significant increase in responsiveness and performance.
- In preliminary tests, a substantial performance gain was observed when translating tables with up to 2,000 events. Above this volume, the interface repaint process impacts performance, which may cause temporary GUI freezes until the workload is completed.
- Important recommendation: To avoid data loss or unexpected application closure, the language should be set BEFORE starting monitoring, especially in high data volume scenarios. Language switching should only be performed with monitoring paused. NEVER change the language during an active monitoring session.

Warning window for language switching:
- A bilingual dialog window has been implemented to notify the user whenever there is a switch between the supported languages.

Expansion and granularity of data columns:
- The columns "Size", "Uncompressed", and "Binary" have been split. Each has given rise to 5 new columns (totaling 15), allowing for more granular and precise filtering and analysis of file and directory sizes.

Redesign of the statistical analysis module:
- The statistical data analysis has been restructured to become compatible with the new metadata columns. This has resulted in higher quality analyses, with better-defined scales and more robust data handling.

Improvement in file monitoring:
- Monitoring accuracy has been enhanced, with greater detail in identifying file types based on their extensions.

Menu interface redesign:
- The menu system design has been improved to organize and display all monitored metadata more clearly and intuitively.

Non-modal secondary windows:
- Secondary interfaces (interactive dialogs) no longer block interaction with the application's main window, allowing for a smoother workflow.

Internationalization of the date filter:
- The period filtering system has been improved. The calendar component for date selection is now compatible with the translation system, displaying month and day names in the selected language.


Summary:

What's New in Version 0.0.2.0:

- Native Translation System (Qt/PySide6): The language system has been completely rewritten to use Qt's native resources, resulting in greater performance and responsiveness.
    - Warning: It is recommended to set the language before starting monitoring to avoid freezes or data loss in high-volume scenarios.

- Interface Improvements (UI/UX):
    - Added a confirmation dialog when switching languages.
    - Secondary windows no longer block the main interface.
    - Redesigned menus for better metadata organization.
    - The date filter calendar is now translated to the selected language.

- More Powerful Data Analysis:
    - The file size columns ("Size", "Uncompressed", "Binary") have been expanded to 15 new columns, allowing for much more precise filters.
    - The statistical analysis module has been updated to support the new columns, generating more detailed and accurate reports.

- Enhanced Monitoring:
    - Improved detection of file types by extension.
